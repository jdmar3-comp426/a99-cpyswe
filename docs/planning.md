## Project Thinking
    - What game should we write?
    - What features should we provide for the user?
    - How do we make the HTML connect to the API?
    - Do the users need to log in to play?
    - Where should we put features like modify and delte account (after log in)?
    - How do we transfer the information stored in database to the frontend?
    - How do we transfer the score in the front end to the API?

## Group Discussion Result For General Questions:
    - We will make a pinball game that eliminate bricks. The score will be the number of bricks eliminated.
    - The user will be able to register, log in, delte and modify account.
    - The user have to be logged in to start game and delte and modify account.
    - The highest score of the user will be recorded in the database (compare the current score with the score in the database).
